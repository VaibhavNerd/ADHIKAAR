Indian Patent Law follows first to file system. A provisional application is an application which can be
filed if the invention is still under experimentation stage. Filing a provisional specification provides 
the advantage to the inventor since it helps in establishing a ―priority date of the invention.

potential and to file the complete specification.
B) ORDINARY APPLICATION
An application for patent filed in the Patent Office without claiming any priority either in a 
convention country or without any reference to any other earlier application under process in the 
office. Such type of application is known an ordinary application.

substantially similar application filed in one or more of the convention countries is known as a 
convention application. In order to get convention status, an applicant should file the application in 
the Indian Patent Office within 12 months from the date of first filing of a similar application in the

the national phase application in India within 31 months from the international filing date or the 
priority date, whichever is earlier.

When an invention is a slight modification of the earlier invention for which he has already applied 
for or has obtained patent, the applicant can go for patent of addition if the modification in the 
invention is new. One of the benefits of filing patent of addition is that there no need to pay 
separate renewal fee for the patent of addition during the term of the main patent and it expires 
along with the main patent.
G) DIVISIONAL APPLICATION
When an application claims more than one invention, the applicant on his own or to meet the 
official objection on the ground of plurality or distinct invention may divide the application and file 
two or more applications, as the case may be for each of the inventions. This type of application, 
divided out of the parent one, is known a Divisional Application. The priority date for all the 
divisional applications will be same as that of the main (the Parent) Application (Ante-dating).
24. Is it necessary to file a provisional application?
Generally, when an invention is not complete an application can be filed with provisional 
specification which is known as provisional application. This is useful in establishing a priority date 
for your invention. Moreover, it also gives sufficient time to the applicant to assess and evaluate the 
market potential of his invention before filing complete specification. However, it is not necessary to 
file an application with provisional specification and one can file application directly with complete 
specification.
